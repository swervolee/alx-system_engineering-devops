# Outage Postmortem: The Great Authentication Adventure üöÄ

## Issue Summary

* Duration: The outage took place from February 9, 2024, at 10:00 PM (UTC) to February 10, 2024, at 2:00 AM (UTC).
* Impact: Ahoy! The authentication service decided to take a siesta, leaving our users stranded on a deserted island of login failures and sluggish response times. Arrr, 'twas a rough voyage for 30% of our users!
* ##### Root Cause: Avast ye! 'Twas a misconfiguration in the load balancer, sending our servers on a wild goose chase and causing chaos in the high seas of authentication.

## Timeline
* 10:00 PM (UTC): Yarr! We spotted trouble on the horizon with monitoring alerts blaring like cannons, signaling high latency and error rates in the authentication service.
* 10:15 PM (UTC): Ahoy, mates! We rallied the engineering crew to man the ship and face the brewing storm.
* 10:30 PM (UTC): We delved into the logs like true pirates searching for buried treasure, hunting down clues to the source of the trouble.
* 11:00 PM (UTC): Shiver me timbers! Our first guess was that Davy Jones might be meddling with our database connections.
* 11:30 PM (UTC): Avast! We hoisted the Jolly Roger and set our sights on the load balancer, uncovering the misconfigurations causing the ruckus.
* 12:00 AM (UTC): With the wind at our backs, we called upon the senior engineering crew to lend their expertise in navigating the treacherous waters of load balancer settings.
* 1:00 AM (UTC): Yo ho ho! We adjusted the sails and fine-tuned the load balancer, distributing the load evenly across our servers once more.
* 2:00 AM (UTC): Land ho! The seas calmed, and our authentication service emerged from the storm, sailing smoothly once again.

## Root Cause and Resolution
* ##### Root Cause: Arrr! 'Twas a misconfiguration in the load balancer, causing some servers to be marooned while others were overrun with traffic.
* Resolution: We hoisted the anchor and made swift adjustments to the load balancer settings, restoring balance to the force and bringing peace to the high seas of authentication.
## Corrective and Preventative Measures
##### Improvements/Fixes:
*Implement automated monitoring to keep a weather eye on load balancer configurations, alerting us to any future squalls.
Conduct regular audits of load balancer settings to ensure smooth sailing and prevent further mutinies.
##### Tasks to Address the Issue:
* Patch the load balancer software to prevent future mutinies and keep our ship afloat in rough seas.
* Develop automated testing procedures to check load balancer settings for hidden treasure and unexpected surprises.
* Train our crew in load balancer management best practices to navigate the waters of configuration safely.

##### Ahoy, me hearties! Though we weathered a fierce storm, we emerged stronger and wiser, ready to sail the seas of authentication with renewed vigor. Smooth sailing ahead, maties! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è‚öìÔ∏è
